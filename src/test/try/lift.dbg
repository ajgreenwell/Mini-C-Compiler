mc: 11:33 2.22.2019. Compiling lift.mc in debug mode.

The input program is:

int f(int a, int b)
{
  int c;
  c = +(+(2, a), *(4, b));
  return
    c
}
int main()
{
  return
    1
}

Type environment is:
% : int * int -> int
* : int * int -> int
** : int * int -> int
+ : int * int -> int
- : int * int -> int
/ : int * int -> int
< : int * int -> bool
<= : int * int -> bool
<> : int * int -> bool
== : int * int -> bool
> : int * int -> bool
>= : int * int -> bool
f : int * int -> int
main :  -> int
not : bool -> bool

The program is well-typed.


After the naming phase:

int f(int a, int b)
{
  int c;
  c =   let 
      x0 : int =
        let 
            x6 : int = 2
            x7 : int = a
            x8 : int = +(x6, x7)
        in
          x8
      x1 : int =
        let 
            x3 : int = 4
            x4 : int = b
            x5 : int = *(x3, x4)
        in
          x5
      x2 : int = +(x0, x1)
  in
    x2
  ;
  return
    c
}
int main()
{
  return
    1
}

After the lifting phase:

int f(int a, int b)
{
  int c;
  c =   let 
      x6 : int = 2
      x7 : int = a
      x8 : int = +(x6, x7)
      x0 : int = x8
      x3 : int = 4
      x4 : int = b
      x5 : int = *(x3, x4)
      x1 : int = x5
      x2 : int = +(x0, x1)
  in
    x2
  ;
  return
    c
}
int main()
{
  return
    1
}

After the copyprop phase:

int f(int a, int b)
{
  int c;
  c =   let 
      x6 : int = 2
      x8 : int = +(x6, a)
      x3 : int = 4
      x5 : int = *(x3, b)
      x2 : int = +(x8, x5)
  in
    x2
  ;
  return
    c
}
int main()
{
  return
    1
}

After the control phase:

f:	(a, b)
	c = 0
	x6 = 2
	x8 = x6 + a
	x3 = 4
	x5 = x3 * b
	x2 = x8 + x5
	c = x2
	x9 = c
	return x9

main:	()
	x10 = 1
	return x10
